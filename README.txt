###CONTROLS###

 Movement - WASD (you should know which goes where, if not guess).
 Menu - M
 Pause - P (not yet implemented)



###TO SWITCH CHARACTERS:###

 Outside of battle - Go to the menu by pressing M while not in battle.  Click on the portrait of any of the 8 heroes.

 Inside of battle - Click on the portrait of any of the 8 heroes. The hero who is last out for the final kill receives all of the AP for the battle.



###TO UNLOCK ABILITIES:###

 Each battle rewards you with AP.  Each ability costs AP.  To view how many AP you have, go to the menu and look towards the bottom and view "AP:"
 The heroes DO NOT share AP.  Each hero is rewarded their own AP.

 Once you have enough AP, click on the ability you want to learn.  The ability tells how many AP is needed.  Once all of the AP is filled you will unlock the ability.
 The ability needs to be added to your action bar.  To do so, click the ability and then click an empty space on your action bar section inside the menu. 
 A maximum of 6 abilities can be used at once.  You can override old abilities by clicking on a square with an ability.  You can add them back.
